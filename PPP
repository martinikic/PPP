from github import Github

# First, create a Github instance using your Github username and access token
g = Github("<your-github-access-token>")

# Replace "<your-github-access-token>" with your actual GitHub access token
# You can create a token by following these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

# Next, get the repository that you want to add the file to
repo = g.get_repo("<your-username>/<your-repo-name>")

# Replace "<your-username>/<your-repo-name>" with the actual username and repository name

# Now, create a new file and add its contents
new_file_content = "This is a new file that has been added to my repository!"
new_file_name = "new_file.txt"

# Create the new file in the repository
new_file = repo.create_file(new_file_name, "initial commit", new_file_content)

# Print a success message
print(f"Created new file '{new_file_name}' in repository '{repo.full_name}'")
